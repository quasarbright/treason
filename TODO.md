- [ ] handle eof
- [ ] graceful error handling
- [ ] properly link the server executable so the command in the extension can just be treason-language-server and not a hard-coded path
- [ ] decouple server logic from json, or at least make convenient wrappers
- [ ] test after making server more testable
- [ ] shutdown
- [ ] figure out client capabilities once you start sending diagnostics. included in the initialize request
- [ ] explicitly define terminology like line, column, position, index, etc.
- [ ] cancellation? optional
- [ ] parse the file on update and store ast, don't want to parse on every operation
  - [ ] define a `find-enclosing-sexpr: loc? -> (or #f stx?)` which finds the enclosing sexpr. goto-definition and goto-references can just do a eq? check to compare identifiers with the given sexpr instead of checking for location. you could also cache parent references to make this even easier.
- [ ] stx patterns or stx matching
- [ ] report diagnostics
- [x] no parent, immutable, simplify tests. macro expansion will make parent weird
- [x] decouple server logic from read/write over wire
- [x] go to definition
- [x] consider decoupling LSP stuff from language stuff. For example, goto-definition returns a result in LSP format and takes in an LSP position, even though stx and spans are the internal types
- [x] when you do "get references", make sure `gd` on definition site fetches references. Currently, goto-definition on the binding site returns `#f`. Might need to make it return the binding site anyway.
